# WHAT IS AN ALGORITHM?

- A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

# PROBLEM SOLVING

- Understand the Problem
- Explore Concrete Examples
- Break It Down
- Solve/Simplify
- Look Back and Refactor

# UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM

## Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum.

- Can I restate the problem in my own words?
    + Thực hiện một phép cộng?
- What are the inputs that go into the problem?
    + Số như nào? số dương hay âm. số có bao nhiêu chữ số? (int, float, large number)
- What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
    + Kết quả của các số input trên như nào? (int, float, ...)
- Can the outputs be determined(*xác định*)  from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
    + 
- How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

## Explore Concrete Examples

    - Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better
    - Examples also  provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should
    - User Stories! Unit Tests!

## BREAK IT DOWN
    - Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.

    This forces you to think about the code you'll write before you write it, and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in and have to worry about details (e.g. language syntax) as well.

## Simplify
    - Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
    - Temporarily ignore that difficulty
    - Write a simplified solution
    - Then incorporate that difficulty back in

## Look Back and Refactor
  ### REFACTORING QUESTIONS
    Can you check the result?
    Can you derive the result differently?
    Can you understand it at a glance?
    Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
    Can you improve the performance of your solution?
    Can you think of other ways to refactor?
    How have other people solved this problem?
    Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string.
